# clr_prediction

This is a repository for [Novel Prediction Techniques Based on Clusterwise Linear Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10742) paper.

The CLR implementation is located in `clr.py` file. 
All prediction algorithms are implemented following scikit-learn base_estimator API in `clr_regressors.py` file.

To reproduce the experiments from the paper, run:
    
    ./run_all.sh
